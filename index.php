            <p>Adding variety to your diet does not mean balanced diet but to add intelligently all food groups in your plate in the right amount. Food variety means eating a wide variety of foods from each of the five food groups, in the amounts recommended. Eating many different foods helps maintain a healthy and interesting diet which provides a range of different nutrients to the body. Eating a variety of foods promotes good health and can help reduce the risk of many diseases.</p>
				<div class="container">
					<div class="nut">
						<img src="images/Nutrition.jpg" class="nutimage">
							<span class="nutval">
								<h4>FIVE MAJOR FOOD GROUPS ARE:</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Grain (cereal) foods, mostly wholegrain and/or high cereal fibre varieties</li>
										<li>Vegetables and fruit</li>
										<li>Lean meats and poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, nuts and seeds, legumes/beans</li>
										<li>Milk and dairy products</li>
										<li>Fats and sugars</li>
									</ul> 
							</span>
					</div>
			
						<h4>Grain (cereal) foods, mostly wholegrain and/or high cereal fibre varieties:</h4>
							<p>One third of the plate should be made up of this food group.
							<p>Staple foods should make up the largest part of a meal. These foods are relatively cheap and supply a good amount of energy and some protein</p>
							<p>Examples of foods in this group include all types of bread, crackers, breakfast cereals, oats, pasta, noodles, rice, potatoes and yams.</p>
							<p>Choose wholemeal or whole grain varieties to increase the fibre on your plate.</p>
							<p>As staple foods are not enough to provide all the nutrients for fulfilling the body needs, other foods must be eaten to provide additional energy, proteins and micronutrients.</p>
		
		
						<h4>Fruit and Vegetables:</h4>
							<p>One third of the plate should be made up of fruit and vegetables.</p>
							<p>Vegetables and fruit are an important part of a healthy and balanced meal. They supply the vitamins and minerals that keep the body functioning and the immune system strong.</p>
							<p>Aim to eat a large variety of fruit and vegetables as different coloured ones provide different nutrients. Choosing fruits and vegetables in season will mean they are at the best for quality and the cheapest.</p>
							<p>Potatoes DO NOT count towards your 5 a day as they are a starchy food.</p>
							
						<h4>Meat, Fish and Eggs and Legumes/Beans:</h4>
							<p>Legumes include beans, peas, lentils, ground-nuts (including peanut butter) and soybeans; animal protein include all forms of meat, poultry (birds), fish, eggs. When eaten with staple foods the quality of protein is increased.</p>
							<p>Choose lean cuts of meat and eat in moderation. Peas and beans are also the part of this group.</p>

			
						<h4>Milk and Dairy Products:</h4>
							<p>Aim to have 3 portions from this food group daily</p>
							<p>All fluid milk products and many foods made from milk are considered part of this food group. Most Dairy Group choices should be fat-free or low-fat.</p>
							<p>Foods made from milk that retain their calcium content are part of the group. Foods made from milk that have little to no calcium, such as cream cheese, cream, and butter, are not. Calcium-fortified soymilk (soy beverage) is also part of the Dairy Group.</p>
			
						<h4>Fatty and Sugary Foods:</h4>
							<p>Fats and oils include butter, lard, margarine, cooking oil (vegetable, coconut and palm oil), cream, mayonnaise and coconut cream. They are also found in avocados, oilseeds (sunflower, groundnut and sesame), fatty meat and fish, curds and cheese.</p>
							<p>Fats, oils and sugar are good sources of energy and can help one gain body weight, which can be particularly important for those living with HIV/AIDS. They also add flavour to food, thereby stimulating appetite</p>
							<p>This is the smallest section of the plate. Foods in this section are high in calories and contain little of other nutrients. They should therefore be consumed occasionally and in small amounts. All fluid milk products and many foods made from milk are considered part of this food group. Most Dairy Group choices should be fat-free or low-fat.</p>

        <h1>Healthy LifeStyle</h1>
			<div class="lifecontainer">
				<div class="life">
					<img src="images/lifestyle.png" class="lifeimage">
						<span class="lifeval">
							<p>As years passes so fast. In no time those bad habits that you have now can do big damage to your mind and body later on. Whether it’s skipping breakfast or eating too fast, drinking a little too much (and too often) or spending way too many hours planted in front of the TV so you have to pay for them later</p>
							<p>Poor health also means more time lost at work, less quality recreational time, and even shorter lifespan. But in this modern day, people have a mindset that takes good health for granted. One can suffer from years of aches and pains, and would just ignore them, and then feel so surprised when one finds out one has developed a serious chronic disease. Majorities would usually leave their health to the hand of the doctors, relying on the advance medical technology, medical drugs when they fall sick. We have the choice to live a healthy lifestyle, but many choose to live just for today, enjoy life, and most of the time end up suffering in pain with chronic diseases and illnesses.</p>
							<p>There are many habits prevalent today which can lead to many health problems. It is important to understand what these are and how the issues can be addressed. We should work on putting an end to the bad habits now, so you don’t pay for them later.</p>
						</span>
				</div>
			
				<h3>COMMON UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLE PRACTICES:</h3>
					<p>Lifestyle has an impact on whether you lead a healthy life or not. Because of the importance it play, it is important to identify the basic unhealthy habits of a typical life style. There are many factors contributing to the degeneration of health among many people today. We live in a terribly polluted world. We are all exposed to thousands of toxins and chemicals every day at work, home, in the air, and in the food that we eat and water we drink. In addition, we are eating more processed and canned foods than ever before in human history and we constantly abuse our bodies with pharmaceuticals. We found fast food at every corner. And video games and TV have led the majority of teens to spend countless hours in front of the television instead of playing outdoor games or doing physical activity. The result of all of these are overweight and obese and many chronic diseases.</p>
		
					<p>There are:</p>
		
				<h4>Smoking & Drinking:</h4>
					<p>Nicotine is an addictive substance which is found in cigarettes. That is what makes it so hard for people to quit smoking. When they just stop smoking, there is high chance that they would experience some withdrawal symptoms, which means that the body will be craving for the nicotine. That’s why there are so many smokers who fail to quit.</p>
					<p>This would top any list of unhealthy lifestyle choices. Smoking has numerous negative effects on the body. It can cause many diseases like Emphysema, lungs’ cancer, the throat and the mouth diseases, birth defects and other ailments of the respiratory system are direct results of smoking. The warnings on cigarette packages were placed to warn people about the real dangers caused by smoking. The smoke produced from the burning tobacco leaves of cigarettes contains thousands of chemicals and a majority of those which are harmful to the body.</p>
			
				<h4>Exercise:</h4>
					<p>Combining too much eating with no or little exercise is a recipe for disaster. In fact the lack of exercise is one of the leading causes of early death. Lack of physical exercise also weakens our muscles and exposes them to physical injuries. Also, irregular or no exercising regularly worsens the immune system and drive our body towards becoming sick frequently.</p>
					<p>An unhealthy lifestyle, which does not consist of regular workouts, is the major cause of bad cholesterol. People, who do not exercise for some time, never remain fit and healthy. Due to improper blood circulation which occurs because of unhealthy lifestyles, the heart’s health never remains in good condition.</p>

			
				<h4>False Eating:</h4>
					<p>Eating too much leads us to obesity, hypertension, diabetes etc. On the contrary, eating too less will deprive of nutrients and will ultimately affect the immune system.</p>
					<p>Another major source of toxic exposure is the foods we eat. Herbicides, pesticides and fungicides are sprayed on our foods while they are growing and after harvest to prevent spoilage and improve marketability.Approximately 90% of the drugs given to animals have not been approved by the government. Half of the antibiotics produced in America annually are given to animals has a matter of routine. 60 to 99% of the cattle slaughtered in this country were given synthetic hormones, primarily estrogens during their growth. It is no longer a question that antibiotic resistance, hormone exposure and toxin exposure are having a negative effect on our health.</p>
					<p>Poor dietary choices will impact your health. Likewise, it is very difficult, if not impossible to lose weight and keep it off when one options for an unhealthy diet. Processed foods and junk foods are, in short, a killer and they are reducing people's lifespan. Processed foods have a high in fats and salt content and are filled with preservatives and colouring and other bad chemicals.</p>
			
				<h4>Taking too much stress and lack of sound sleep:</h4>
					<p>Stress is a natural body reaction. Our lives are already becoming stressful and there are two primary stresses – Work place tension and Family Tension. Now, I have not seen anyone who takes the family tension to workplace. But we all have accustomed of bringing the work tension to home which ruins the family harmony. In principal, our family environment should sooth the senses and helps us ease out the work place worries. However, once we start bringing the outer stress to our home, we do not have a place to escape.</p>
					<p>It is during sleep that the body repairs the cells that have been damaged through the day of activity. Obviously, it is also the time that the body gets its rest. But some people do not give that much importance to it as they should. If you compromise with sound sleep, you feel sluggish and weak.</p>
			
				<h4>HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHANGES FOR LEADING A HEALTHY LIFE:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Don’t smoke</li>
						<li>Control your weight- prevents many diseases like heart diseases,kidney diseases, diabetes mellitus, etc.</li>
						<li>Drink alcohol in moderation- not more than 60ml for male and 30ml for female in a day.</li>
						<li>Exercise regularly- brisk walk, jogging, running dancing etc.</li>
						<li>Get a regular health check-up.</li>
						<li>Drink 10-12 glasses of water every day.</li>
						<li>Eat from good nutritional sources- include all 5 food groups.</li>
						<li>Skip the soda-it adds empty calories.</li>
						<li>Deal intelligently with stress.</li>
					</ul>

							<h1>Blood Type Diet Food List</h1>
								<p>Your blood type is a powerful means of interpreting individual variations in health and disease. It is a powerful genetic blueprint that identifies you as surely as your DNA, and it is easy and inexpensive to determine. When you use the individual guidepost of your blood type for eating and living, you will be healthier, you will naturally reach your ideal weight, and you will slow the natural process of aging. The key significance to blood type can be found in the story of human evolution. Type O is the earliest success formula; Type A thrived with the change to an agrarian society; Type B adapted as humans migrated north into colder, harsher territories; and Type AB is a thoroughly modern invention, a result of the intermingling of disparate groups. Don’t know your blood type? Donate blood, ask your doctor on your next office visit, or use the easy, at home blood typing kit to reveal the key to your individuality.</p>

							<h1>Blood Type B Diet Food List</h1>
								<p>B is for balance! An omnivorous diet is recommended for Type B, with a focus on organic meats, dairy, and vegetables. Dr. D’Adamo cautions Type B against consuming chicken, corn, and wheat as those foods contain a protein lectin that interferes with metabolic function. When Type B is out of balance, they are at an increased risk for depression, insulin resistance, and hypothyroidism. Daily exercise that engages both the mind and body, such as golf or tennis, helps Type B to thrive.</p>
